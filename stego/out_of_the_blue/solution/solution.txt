Stepping through the binary of the file and looking only at the blue values, make an array of all of the 0s and 1s until hitting the delimiter 1111111111111110.
Then take that array (minus the delimiter) and convert it from binary to a string of characters

the included steg.py file will help automate this.

Alternatively, you can search the internet for "steganography 1111111111111110" and find the same python script.

If you can install PIL and run the following command, the flag will pop out
