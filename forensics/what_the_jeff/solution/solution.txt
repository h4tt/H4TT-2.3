The easiest way to do this is to use Git blame on Github. In the AUTHORS file, you are able to click on the line number of Jeff Welch, then have easy access to the commit.

Another easy way to do this is use git bisect.

git checkout master
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git checkout `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD | tail -n 1`
git bisect good

from here, you can use `git bisect bad` for anything that has Jeff Welch in it, and `git bisect good` for anything that doesn't have them.

Note - the lengthy checkout is used to checkout the first commit on master.
