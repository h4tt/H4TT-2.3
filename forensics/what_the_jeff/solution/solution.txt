An easy way to do this is use git bisect.

git checkout master
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git checkout `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD | tail -n 1`
git bisect good

from here, you can use `git bisect bad` for anything that has Jeff Welch in it, and `git bisect good` for anything that doesn't have them.

Note - the lengthy checkout is used to checkout the first commit on master.
