1. Recover patterns
    - Recover the 3 position patterns
    - Recover the alignment patterns
    - Recover timing
2. Recover format information
    - Enough format information was left in to see that the only format information string that would work is mask pattern 3

3. Use a QR code reader
    - There is enough information at this point to leave the rest of the corruption to error correction.
